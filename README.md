# RobotTool
Tool for detecting changes on webpages.

The robot tool helps statisticians detecting and processing changes on web sites.
At this moment this is mainly used for detecting price changes, but in principle the tool could be used to detect any change in a particular part of a website.

In this repo we maintain and publish an international version of the tool.
Other organisations are invited to download, experiment and use it.
The tool is provided under an EUPL licence on an ‘as is’ basis and without warranties of any kind as specified in the attached license file.
Feedback is highly appreciated (by email or by adding an issue ticket on this repo).

The development of this tool was partly subsidized by a Grant from Eurostat. Previous versions were published at our 
[research server](http://research.cbs.nl/Projects/RobotTool).
