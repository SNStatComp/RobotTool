# RobotTool
Tool for detecting changes on webpages

The robot tool helps statisticians detecting and processing changes on web sites. At this moment this is mainly used for detecting price changes by price statisticians, but in principle the tool could be used to detect any change in a prticular part of a website.

In this github repo we maintain and publish an international version of the tool. Other National or International statistical organisations are invited to download, experiment and use it, "as is" as specified in the attached EUPL license. Feedback is highly  appreciated (by email or by adding an issue ticket on this repo).

The development of this tool was partly subsidized by a Grant from Eurostat. Previous versions were published at our 
[research server](http://research.cbs.nl/Projects/RobotTool).
